<h3 id='study_failure'><strong>Study Failure</strong></h3>

<p>Software fails, and the cost of failure extremely high. Fight failure successfully and you&#8217;ll save bigtime. But how does one fight failure? The answer is simple: <strong>Study it.</strong></p>

<p>This sounds about as exciting as a <a class='plainlink' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_sigma'>Six Sigma class</a>, but it turns out it&#8217;s actually quite fascinating. After a while, patterns emerge. These patterns represent bad choices that end up costing a fortune, and are best avoided.</p>

<p>We all know that the real reason it&#8217;s fun to study failure is the overwhelming sense of relief that comes from knowing that some other poor sap had to go through this, and NOT ME!</p>

<p>Anyway I&#8217;m calling these patterns <strong>Enterprise Disintegration Antipatterns</strong> since they affect corporations of all sizes, they have damaging (disintegrating) consequences, and therefore like all antipatterns, should be avoided.</p>
<img src='/assets/images/collapsingbuilding.jpg' width='356' />
<p><strong>Without a solid foundation the enterprise will disintegrate</strong></p>

<pre><code>   An Enterprise Disintegration Antipattern is any repeated
   behavior that tends towards failure of enterprise software or
   enterprise software organizations.</code></pre>

<p><strong>Ed note: it still sounds mind-numbinginly boring</strong> <strong>See SIDEBAR How much does this cost?</strong> <strong>See SIDEBAR What is an antipattern?</strong></p>

<p>The good news is that with a solid foundation, many/most of these patterns can be avoided.</p>

<p>This series follows a pattern itself, which is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify and describe a common antipattern</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Identify likely causes</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Describe how issue can be avoided using PaaS</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Summarize cost to implement (tco)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Summary total value/gain</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This blog series highlights that that tends towards a less desirable result. It turns out antipatterns are rampant in enterprise software development. Whether large or small, established or startup, failure, failure happens.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve around a while you&#8217;ve almost certainly seen your share of failure. And if you</p>

<p>Among the countless failures, big and small, that occur in corporations, big and small, are many</p>

<p>Which is the subject of this talk: reocurrding patterns that often lead toward software failure.</p>

<h2 id='study_failure'>Study Failure</h2>

<p>s is true in with almost anything, close observation of failure yields re-occuring patterns.</p>

<p>Enterprise Failure seems particularly suited to pattern extraction as you&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>For years, every time I experienced or observered failure at my current job, I would consider it</p>

<p>For a long time, I assume that the failure observed was a (forgive the expression) singleton</p>

<p>But, like anything else, exposure to something often unveils about patterns in the</p>

<p>arethis is nothing new. It&#8217;s slightly disturbing to note that with even with Moore&#8217;s law, mind-numbing advances in technology, tools, computer languages, networks, methadologies, test frameworks, &#8230; that we generally still cannot reliably create a system that we can comfortably say &#8220;just works&#8221;.</p>

<h2 id='step_1_define_your_sidebars'>Step 1: Define your sidebars</h2>

<p>(Ed: It&#8217;s true: I know this old guy who used to work in a data center with all these ancient IBM 1403&#8230;, and he says that programming is WAY sloppier now than ever. Back then - they web</p>

<p>with all our evolutions, software is continuing to fail. It seems not enough effort is spent fixing failure.</p>

<p>everyone knows that. Effort spent reducing failure seems well worth it.</p>

<p>a natural focus for any developer. The fastest way to avoid failing is by failing. But the best way to avoid failing is observing it when it occurs.</p>

<h2 id='anvils'>(anvils)</h2>

<p>AntiPattern One: Optimize early</p>

<p>This is one of the most tantelizing, seductive, and &#8230; nefarious antipatterns. In fact avoiding it is one of the harder engineering problems. Well, hardest engineer problems anyway.</p>

<p>Consider this O(n4): Problem: documents with words , find &#8230; who knows. but this should be easy. Scenerio:</p>

<p>for .. for for for end</p>

<p>You know - it&#8217;s SO tempting to spend a few minutes fixing this. But don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>WHY: Five reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>it&#8217;s probably fast already</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>it&#8217;s probably fast enough</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>faster usually more complex (engineer time vs. cpu time)</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>3a. optimization often leads to obfuscation</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>requirements change</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>your time can be MUCH better spent</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Just Say No!</p>

<p>This is really hard to do: it&#8217;s such a blast to take an method, algorithm, whole application, and Make It FFFaast.</p>

<p>Many software engineerings thrive on this alone.</p>

<p>But&#8230; resist Resitance Is Infutile.</p>

<p>Instead of opgimizing: WRITE TESTS!</p>

<p>More generally, measure the performance in a repeatable way. Use tests or tools or process, whatever you like, just make sure it can be repeated.</p>

<p>I.e., trade the 15 minutes (400 hours) you would have spent optimizing the above code for testing time. Set up a test process, research tools, fiddle around with rspec/cucumber/selenium, stand up from your cubicle and yell TEST to everyone within hearing distance.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Test, don&#8217;t optimize. This is a general theme of this series.</p>

<p>But how is this relevant here?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re reading this magazine chances are you&#8217;re well versed in the various &#8220;Premature Optimization discussions&#8221; triggured decades Dr Dobbs Readers know this already. Premature Optimization has long been eschewed by engineering best practices. And testing is, after a long arduous journey, finally becoming mainstream.</p>

<p>But pre-omptimization is almost always thought of as tweaking code to make it faster. There are other aspedts of premature optimization that aren&#8217;t so obvious, or cut and dry.</p>

<p>Scenerio</p>

<p>You have the software idea of a lifetime, and you just <em>know</em> this one&#8217;s going to go viral and earn you that yaught/helicoptor combo you&#8217;ve been yearning for.</p>

<p>You determine that a message bus and integration framework is a good solution to the problem, and should scale. You want to use a message queu for similar reasons, for framework reasons you thing AMQ is the way to go.</p>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>So you spend a few days evaluating various message broker products: ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, Sparrow, Starling, Kestrel, Amazon SQS, Beanstalkd, Kafka. You know you want</p>

<p>But:</p>

<p>Instead</p>
<hr />
<p>Demo / or Blog:</p>

<p>Instantly build ActiveMQ app with node/ror/play + RabbitMQ and mongo: then BLAST it with jMeter.</p>

<p>Bonus: gmaps and kaazing</p>

<p>Then scale it!</p>
<hr />
<p>viral. &#8216;re building the next facebook, and you know it needs to scale.</p>

<p>the beginning of you spend weeks evaluating</p>

<p>RabbitMQ ActiveMQ Tibco</p>

<p>This is one of the hardest engineering problems known:</p>

<p>Readers of this magazine know this already. But even so, it&#8217;</p>
